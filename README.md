# Sierpinski_Triangle

Once I was scrolling through reels on instagram and saw someone explaining what a Sierpinski Triangle is and how to make it. He was doing it on a sheet of paper. I saw it. I liked it and I decided to make it myself, but since I'm laz... efficient person, I've decided to use python instead of a pan and a sheet of paper. So here it is.
A simple code that generates Sierpinski Triangle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).
For now, the code uses built-in lists for a readibility, but soon I will convert it all to the numpy arrays, in order to increase the speed.
